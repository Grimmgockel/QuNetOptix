    "### SimulaQron\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does:\n",
    "- SimulaQron is a tool for developing software applications running on the end nodes of a QI\n",
    "- It simulates multiple QPUs held by the end nodes in single networks, as well as multiple connected networks, thus simulating QI\n",
    "- It acts as a platform-dependant stand-in mimicking a real network of multiple systems and facilitating platform-independant development w/o Q-hardware\n",
    "- Its main functionality is the simulation of qubit exchange and entanglement (w/o providing entanglement management functionalities)\n",
    "- Its modular structural design enables the use of a multitude of quantum computer simulations to serve as a backend via Python\n",
    "- The goal of SimulaQron is to realize QI based software applications which can later run and with real quantum hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "What it does not:\n",
    "- No entanglement management functionalities (still in development [20])\n",
    "- No inherent security guarantees on simulated qubits\n",
    "- Not a simulation for large scale quantum internet (testing quantum repeater schemes, error correcting codes, study the effects of noise on distant qubits etc.)\n",
    "- No simulation of realistic noise and timings (for this, use NetSquit + SimulaQron)\n",
    "- No security or authentification efforts for accessing the simulated QPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges:\n",
    "- Simulating entanglement classicly: for two entangled qubits *A* and *B* their state matrix must be virtually available to both nodes\n",
    "- Qubits as a shared resource: Gates performed can create and destroy entanglement, the common challenges for concurrent access of resources in a network apply"

    "- A `simulatedQubit` object is local to the node simulating it in its `quantumRegister`\n",
    "- To marshall the mapping of virtual qubits **Twisted's Perspective Broker** is used\n",
    "- The `quantumEngine` is the interface provided by the simulator to be made available as a backend for SimulaQron\n",
    "- The `quantumEngine` functions as a `quantumRegister` addressing individual qubits by their position in the register\n",
    "- Every `simulatedQubit` is manipulated directly w/o interacting with the `quantumRegister`\n",
    "- Every `simulatedQubit` keeps track of its position in the register, thus preventing arbitrary growth of the register when removing and adding qubits to it (i.e. by measuring) \n",
    "- Two entangled `virtualQubit`s corresponding `simulatedQubit`s have to both be located within the same `quantumRegister`, requiring the `virtualNode` design\n",
    "- The management behind `virtualQubit`s is client-server-based for every application using SimulaQron, giving full access to `virtualQubit`s in the system\n"
