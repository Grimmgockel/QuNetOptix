    "In a Quantum Internet (QI) ... <explain what a QI is>.\n",
    "One could say an Internet running on and being complemented by quantum communication is being built at two fronts.\n",
    "<explain already done implementations>\n",
    "Then there is the development of protocols ecceeding the capabilities of classical communcation in theory and simulation.\n",
    "In [] the latter is conceptualized into <explain the stages>.\n",
    "Although these protocols are often missing years of advancements in enabling technology there are several efforts to unify their engineering process building towards and upon an entire catalogue of innovative quantum communication schemes just waiting for the progress in hardware to be made.\n",
    "One such effort is presented in [<qprotocol zoo>].\n",
    "The attempt is to standardize the QI protocol formulation, modularize protocols into sub-protocols for ease of reuse and create a knowledge repository that is closely connected to the stages of advancment of QI technology.\n",
    "The suggested framework will be implemented in the context of this work.\n",

    "To tackle the problem a theoretical basis has to be given beforehand.\n",
    "The most important general concepts of Quantum Information (QI) such as Qubits, Superposition, Entanglement and No-Cloning Theorem will be explained first.\n",
    "These principles in conjunction with low level quantum protocols such as Quantum Teleportation and Entanglement Swapping lay the foundation of this work.\n",
    "Furthermore, challenges regarding physical qubit transmission due to environmental phenomena like fidelity and decoherence will to be explored to give context to the problem at hand.\n",
    "The different optimization methods used in the experiment will also briefly be covered in advance.\n",
